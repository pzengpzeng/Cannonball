# Monkeyball

## Background and Overview

One of my favorite parts of the Donkey Kong series was when you'd load yourself up in a barrel, blast yourself off into the air, and cross your fingers that you'd timed your liftoff correctly so that you'd land in the next barrel with your life intact. Monkeyball is inspired by this game mechanic and lets you traverse from cannon to cannon to your heart's content. Want to show off your skills? Try to make it onto the leaderboard!
